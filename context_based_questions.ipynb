      "\n",
      "Check for Responsiveness:\n",
      "- Gently shake the person and shout to see if they respond.\n",
      "- If there is no response, check their airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs of first aid).\n",
      "\n",
      "CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation):\n",
      "- If the person is not breathing, start CPR.\n",

      "\n",
      "Control Bleeding:\n",
      "- Apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage.\n",
      "- If bleeding is severe, continue to apply pressure and seek professional help immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treating Shock:\n",
      "- Lay the person down and elevate their legs slightly.\n",
      "- Keep them warm and calm until help arrives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wound Care:\n",
      "- Clean the wound with clean water.\n",
      "- Apply an antiseptic and cover it with a sterile bandage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burns:\n",

      "- Cover with a non-stick, sterile bandage or cloth.\n",
